@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication
@*  Add a callback on Log out success, this will cause the Authentication
    component to re-render. The Action is a string, and therefore,
    the RemoveAuthenticatorView should not be updated according to this:
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/rendering?view=aspnetcore-5.0
    Specifically it says:
    - All of the parameter values are of known immutable primitive types
    (for example, int, string, DateTime) and haven't changed since the
    previous set of parameters were set.
*@
<RemoteAuthenticatorView Action="@Action" OnLogOutSucceeded=@LogOutSucceded />

@code{
    [Parameter] public string Action { get; set; }

    // We add a simple callback that does nothing but write to the console.
    // Upon execution the Action parameter seems to trigger the RemoteAuthenticatorView
    // which attempts to log out again. Without a valid signout state it fails.
    public Task LogOutSucceded(RemoteAuthenticationState state)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Callback reached");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
